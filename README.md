# Track 2: Forecasting Future Turn-Based Strokes in Badminton Rallies

## :badminton: Task Introduction
The goal of this track is to **forecast future strokes including shot types and locations given the past stroke sequences**, namely stroke forecasting. For each singles rally, given the observed 4 strokes with type-area pairs and two players, the goal is to predict the future strokes including shot types and area coordinates for the next n steps. n is various based on the length of the rally.

## :badminton:	Problem Definition

Let $R=\{S_r, P_r\}_{r=1}^{|R|}$ denote historical rallies of badminton matches, where the $r$-th rally is composed of a stroke sequence with type-area pairs $S_r=(\langle s_1, a_1\rangle,\cdots,\langle s_{|S_r|}, a_{|S_r|}\rangle)$ and a player sequence $P_r=(p_1,\cdots,p_{|S_r|})$.
At the $i$-th stroke, $s_i$ represents the shot type, $a_i=\langle x_i, y_i\rangle \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$ are the coordinates of the shuttle destinations, and $p_i$ is the player who hits the shuttle. We denote Player A as the served player and Player B as the other for each rally in track2. For instance, given a singles rally between Player A and Player B, $P_r$ may become $(A, B, \cdots, A, B)$.
We formulate the problem of stroke forecasting as follows. For each rally, given the observed $\tau$ strokes $(\langle s_i, a_i\rangle)_{i=1}^{\tau}$ with players $(p_i)_{i=1}^{\tau}$, the goal is to predict the future strokes including shot types and area coordinates for the next $n$ steps, i.e., $(\langle s_i, a_i\rangle)_{i={\tau+1}}^{\tau+n}$.

$$

l_i = AVG(CE + MAE)&
= \frac{ \sum_{r=1}^{|R|} \sum_{n=\tau+1}^{|r|} [S_n log \hat{S_n} + (|x_n-\hat{x_n}|+|y_n-\hat{y_n}|)]} {|R|\cdot(|r|-\tau)} &

## :badminton:	Baseline: ShuttleNet
### Overview
ShuttleNet is the first turn-based sequence forecasting model containing two encoder-decoder modified Transformer as extractors, and a position-aware gated fusion network for fusing these contexts to tackle stroke forecasting in badminton.
Please refer to the [paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20341) for more details.
Here we adapt ShuttleNet to our newly collected dataset as the official baseline in the CoachAI Badminton Challenge.
All hyper-parameters are set as the same in the paper.
